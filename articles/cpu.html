					<p>If you take the processor inside your phone, tablet or computer
						and "zoom in", this is the computer you get. 
						Well at least functionally, it has all the principal 
						components of a processor like the ALU, Registers and it has most of the fundamental 
						electronic components - flip flops and logic gates.
					</p>
					<p> What continually fascinates me about having built this computer is how it compares to 
						a modern computer	 in its size -
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						A modern computer built at this scale would be larger in area than
						New York City.
					</blockquote>
					<p>Here are the specs of this computer:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>8-bit</li>
						<li>Clock speed - 450Hz</li>
						<li>16 bytes RAM</li>
						<li>No ROM</li>
					</ul>
					<p> So nowhere near as powerful as what you would find in a modern 
						computer - 64-bit, GHz clock speeds, GBs RAM and hunders of GB ROM.
					</p>
					<p> Here is a quick video showing the computer count: </p>
