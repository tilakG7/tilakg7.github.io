					<p>This is a project I am currently working on. I've always been very interested
                        to learn more about how an Exchange works. Most people don't realize the 
                        complex software at play in exchanges, but I'm fascinated by it.
					</p>
					<p> My goal with this project was to build my own exchange and iterate on the design
                        to make it faster and more realistic. Having iterated on the design, I have chosen 
                        cache friendly data structures and programming paradigms to speed up the code.
                        I'm adding multithreading and profiling my code to investigate where things can 
                        be faster!
