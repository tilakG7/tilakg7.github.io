					<p>Hi, I'm Tilak.</p>
					<p>I'm an alumnus of the University of Waterloo, where I graduated 
						from the Mechatronics Engineering Program.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most recently I've been working with Zoox, helping develop the embedded software
						platform our vehicles use to navigate roads autonomously.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to work with software in resource contraint environments, and have increasing 
						experience in designing and implementing software across a wide domain. 
						I have a passion for developing in C++ and am always striving to get better.
					</p>
