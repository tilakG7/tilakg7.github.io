					<p>This is a project I am currently working on. I've always found it 
						peculiar that more colorful lighting has not made a more permanent 
						impact in our lives. Lighting in our homes and workspaces are mostly 
						in the range of cool white to warm white.
					</p>
					<p> My goal with this project is to engineer a LED smart light that is bright,
						offers color control and is relatively cheap. Smart lights in the market are 
						normally lacking in at least one of these areas. I'm also gaining more embedded prototyping
						experience with this project.
					</p>
					<p>The major deisgn areas of this project are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Choosing LEDs</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Brightness, power consumption, package thermal resistance are among the factors</li>
						</ul>
						<li>LED Driving Circuitry</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Designing the current control hardware</li>
						</ul>
						<li>LED Thermal Management</li>
						<ul>
							<li>LEDs are about 25% efficient. That means a lot of heat needs to be removed.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Control Circuitry</li>
						<ul>
							<li>WiFi control and physical button/touch.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Control Firmware</li>
						<li>Enclosure Design</li>
						<li>Procurement and Contruction</li>
					</ul>


					<p> I am currently prototyping the control circuitry and contorl firmware, and 
						have enclosure design left. Parts are arriving and contruction is happening (slowly).
